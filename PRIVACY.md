# Blixt Wallet Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: 2025-07-04**

## Our Commitment to Privacy

Blixt Wallet is built with privacy as a core principle. We believe your financial data should remain private and under your control.

## Information We Don't Collect

- **No User Tracking**: We do not implement any intentional user tracking mechanisms such as Firebase Analytics or similar services within the app
- **No Personal Data**: We do not collect, store, or transmit personal information, transaction data, or wallet information to our servers
- **No Third-Party Analytics**: We do not use third-party analytics services to monitor your app usage

## Information Collected by App Stores

While we don't collect data ourselves, the platforms that distribute our app may collect limited information:

- **Google Play Store**: May collect basic app usage statistics and crash reports as part of their standard distribution service
- **Apple TestFlight/App Store**: May collect basic app usage statistics and crash reports as part of their standard distribution service

This data collection is controlled by Google and Apple respectively, not by Blixt Wallet. Please refer to their privacy policies for more information about their data practices.

## Data Storage

- All wallet data is stored locally on your device
- We do not maintain servers that store user data
- Your Bitcoin transactions are recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, which is public by design

## Lightning Network Channels

- If you open Lightning channels to the Blixt LSP (Lightning Service Provider) node, we will have knowledge of these channel openings as part of the normal operation of the Lightning Network
- This is necessary for providing Lightning Network services and is limited to the technical requirements of operating Lightning channels

_This policy reflects our commitment to user privacy and our principle of not tracking users._
